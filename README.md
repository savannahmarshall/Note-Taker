# Note-Taker

## Description
This web-based application allows users to write and save notes, helping them organize their thoughts and manage tasks. I built this application using starter code provided for the challenge.

### Key Learnings:
* **Express.js:** Developed a deeper understanding of using Express.js alongside Node.js.
* **DELETE Request:** Implemented DELETE requests using fetch to ensure the delete button works correctly, enabling users to remove notes from the list.
* **GET and POST Requests:** Utilized GET and POST requests to retrieve and save data, ensuring the application functions smoothly.

### Challenges Faced:
* **Delete Functionality:** Initially, I encountered difficulties with the delete functionality, but after thorough debugging, I successfully resolved the issue.
* **Working with Starter Code:** Understanding and modifying code I didnâ€™t originally write was challenging, but it provided valuable experience in debugging and adapting existing code.

Through these challenges, I enhanced my skills in creating applications with an Express.js backend.
